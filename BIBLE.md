# 📖 DEGEN PRIME SHOP: THE BIBLE

## 🎯 CORE VISION
To build a high-conviction, high-performance market for the "Degen" community. This isn't just a shop; it’s a destination for power-users who value speed, raw design, and elite merchandise.

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (NEXT.JS 15)
* **Root Structure:** Flattened directory with `src/app` as the primary application engine.
* **Optimization:** React Compiler (Reactor) enabled for automatic build-time memoization.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 using the `@theme` directive for custom design tokens.
* **Routing:** Next.js App Router for high-speed client-side transitions.
* **Import Alias:** `@/*` mapped to `./src/*` for clean absolute imports.
